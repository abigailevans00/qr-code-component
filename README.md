## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Flexbox


### What I learned

This was a quick and simple project. I learned how to improve my HTML to better organize the contents of the page. I reverse-engineered the design the find better alignment and sizing options in CSS.


### Continued development

I would like to improve my CSS Flexbox understanding.
